//! Formally Verified Risk Engine for Perpetual DEX
//!
//! ⚠️ EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY - NOT PRODUCTION READY ⚠️
//!
//! This is an experimental research project for educational purposes only.
//! DO NOT use with real funds. Not independently audited. Not production ready.
//!
//! This module implements a formally verified risk engine that guarantees:
//! 1. User funds are safe against oracle manipulation attacks (within time window T)
//! 2. PNL warmup prevents instant withdrawal of manipulated profits
//! 3. ADL haircuts apply to unwrapped PNL first, protecting user principal
//! 4. Conservation of funds across all operations
//! 5. User isolation - one user's actions don't affect others
//!
//! All data structures are laid out in a single contiguous memory chunk,
//! suitable for a single Solana account.
